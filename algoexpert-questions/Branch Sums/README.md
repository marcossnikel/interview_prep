# Branch Sums ðŸŒ²âš™

### Topic : TREE

#### Notes:

- Recursive function in each node in the three , starting at the root node. **DFS**
    - Left side of the tree and them the right side

- Keep track of an **running sum** -> obtained in node above us.
- Functions need to run until have right or left nodes.

- LeafNodes : Neighter left node or right node -> Sum the current value of the **running sum** to an array of sums **ListSums**



**RECURSIVE SOLUTION**
 1. Recursive function receveing the node , the running sum and the list of sums.
 2. Declare an empty list.
 3. Keep track of the running sum. *Running Sum = sum of all nodes above it*
 4. In the function , calculate the new running sum `newRunningSum = runSum + node.value`
 5. Check if are an leaf node. (*no left or right nodes*) and append the new Sum.
 6. If not in leaf node:
       - Call the function in both nodes (right,left) passing the newRunningSum.
 7.  Return the sums list. 

 *EDGE CASE :* If we have just one child (right or node) we donÂ´t want to look for `None.value`so we need to have an check in the top of our algorithm `if node is none: return`

## Complexity
**Time :** O(N) *N is the total of nodes in the binary tree*

**Space :** O(N) *Complicated -> afected by the list of branch sums and also effect by the recursive nature of the solution 'callstack'*

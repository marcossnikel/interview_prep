# Tournament Winner
# There's an algorithms tournament taking place in which teams of programmers compete against each other 
# to solve algorithmic problems as fast as possible. Teams compete in a round robin, where each team faces off 
# against all other teams. Only two teams compete against each other at a time, and for each competition, one team 
# is designated the home team, while the other team is the away team. In each competition there's always one winner 
# and one loser; there are no ties. A team receives 3 points if it wins and 0 points if it loses. The winner of the 
# tournament is the team that receives the most amount of points.

# Given an array of pairs representing the teams that have competed against each other and an array containing the results 
# of each competition, write a function that returns the winner of the tournament. The input arrays are named competitions and 
# results, respectively. The competitions array has elements in the form of [homeTeam, awayTeam], where each team is a string of 
# at most 30 characters representing the name of the team. The results array contains information about the winner of each corresponding competition in the competitions array. Specifically, results[i] denotes the winner of competitions[i], where a 1 in the results array means that the home team in the corresponding competition won and a means that the away team won.
# It's guaranteed that exactly one team will win the tournament and that each team will compete against all other teams exactly 
# once. It's also guaranteed that the tournament will always have at least two teams.

#example
# competitions = [
#     ['HTML','C#'],
#     ['C#','Python'],
#     ["Python","HTML"]
# ]
# results = [0,0,1]
# Output = Python

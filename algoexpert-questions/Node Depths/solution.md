# Node Depths 🌲⚙

### Topic : TREE

#### Notes:

- IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW THE DEPTH OF AN SPECIFIC NODE WITHOUT HAVE ACCESS TO THE REST OF THE TREE :mega:
- Is necessary to us have information about all parent nodes of the specific child.
- We know the root depth (0) , and with this information we know the depth of both child nodes (depth + 1) and so on and so far.
- So, the thing is, tell to all childs of nodes this quote *Your depth is my own depth plus 1*
- If don´t have children nodes -> **STOP**



**RECURSIVE SOLUTION**

1. Call the recursive function in the childs of our root.
2. We pass the root depth (0) and say to the child that his depth is `root depth + 1`
3. our function stay something like that :
    - F(Node,Depth) = depth + F(leftNode,depth+1) + F(rightNode,depth+1)

**INTERACTIVE SOLUTION**

1. We use an stack to traverse the tree
    1. Our stack keeps an HashMap with the node and his depth `[{"node" : root, "depth" : 0}]`
2. Add the root node in the top of the stack.
3. *So long we have nodes in the stack, pop them off the stack and apply the algorithm*
4. Keep track of the 'runningSum' -> when pop add the popped num to the sum.
5. Look their children -> púsh to the top of the tree stack.
6. Give the parent depth, make depth + 1 and add to the runningSum.
## Complexity

**Time :** O(N) *N is the total of nodes in the binary tree*

**Space :** O(H) *Complicated -> H is the height of the binary tree. || in balanced trees, O(H) seems like O(log n)*
